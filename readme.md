# terraform-gcp-backend

> Deploy a Node.js API on Google Cloud using Terraform (and keep it live without spending a penny).

## What's included

- Node.js API, using Fastify
- Database, using Cloud Firestore
- Hosting, using Cloud Functions
- CI/CD, using Cloud Build (soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è)
<!-- - Frontend, using IDK (soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è) -->

## Prerequisites

- `terraform`
- `node` (latest version supported by [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/nodejs-runtime))
- `gcloud`

## Develop

1. Write your code on `src/` and run:

```bash
# Run function locally
npm run dev
```

2. Write tests on `test/`

```bash
npm run test
```

## Deploy

0. Create a Google Cloud account and set up Billing

1. Initialize the CLI

```bash
gcloud init
```

2. Create a new project

```bash
# Replace PROJECT_ID with your Project ID.
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID --name="My App"
```

3. Set the project as default

```bash
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```

4. Enable billing

```bash
# List billing accounts
gcloud beta billing accounts list

# Link a billing account to project
gcloud beta billing projects link PROJECT_ID --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID
```

5. Create the initial bucket

This bucket will store the `.tfstate` files.

```bash
gsutil mb gs://PROJECT_ID-tfstate
```

6. Rename `terraform.tfvars.example`

```bash
# Development
mv terraform/environments/development/terraform.tfvars.example terraform/environments/development/terraform.tfvars

# Production
mv terraform/environments/production/terraform.tfvars.example mv terraform/environments/production/terraform.tfvars
```

7. On `terraform/` folder, find and replace `PROJECT_ID` with your Project IDs.

8. Deploy ü§û

```bash
# Development
cd terraform/environments/development

# Production
cd terraform/environments/production

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

You will see the function URL at the end of the result.

## Destroy

To shut everything down, run the following commands on this order:

```bash
# Delete all infrastructure
terraform destroy

# Optional: delete the project
gcloud projects delete PROJECT_ID
```

## Troubleshooting

**Deployment** 

When deploying for the first time, it can happen that _Cloud Functions API_ and _Cloud Build API_ are still being enabled and `terraform apply` will fail. Just wait a few minutes and run the command again.
